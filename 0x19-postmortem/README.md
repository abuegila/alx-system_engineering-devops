# Postmortem: The Great Server Meltdown of 2025

## Issue Summary
On **March 3, 2025, at 02:00 AM UTC**, our production web server experienced a **critical failure** that resulted in **total service downtime** for approximately **3 hours and 45 minutes**, with normal operations restored by **05:45 AM UTC**.

### Impact
- **100% of users** were unable to access the application.
- API endpoints returned **502 Bad Gateway** errors.
- **Estimated 5,000 users** were affected during peak hours.
- Downtime caused **loss of critical transactions** and impacted customer trust.

### Root Cause
The failure was traced back to **an unhandled memory leak** in the application, which **exhausted system resources** and caused the server to become unresponsive.

---

## Timeline

- **02:00 AM UTC** - Monitoring system detected high response times.
- **02:05 AM UTC** - Automated alerts were sent to the on-call engineer.
- **02:15 AM UTC** - Engineer logged in and confirmed **502 errors** on all endpoints.
- **02:30 AM UTC** - Initial assumption: a network issue. Network logs were reviewed but no anomalies were found.
- **02:45 AM UTC** - Attempted to restart Nginx, but the issue persisted.
- **03:00 AM UTC** - Escalated to the backend engineering team.
- **03:15 AM UTC** - Backend logs showed excessive memory usage leading to OOM (Out of Memory) crashes.
- **03:30 AM UTC** - Identified that a **recent deployment introduced a memory leak** due to an improperly handled database query loop.
- **04:00 AM UTC** - Rolled back the latest deployment.
- **04:30 AM UTC** - Server started recovering, but slow response times persisted.
- **05:00 AM UTC** - Restarted all affected services and cleared stale connections.
- **05:45 AM UTC** - Normal service fully restored.

## Root Cause and Resolution
The root cause was an inefficient database query inside a **while loop**, causing excessive memory consumption. As memory usage increased, the server ran out of RAM, leading to an **Out of Memory (OOM) kill**, crashing the application.

### Resolution Steps
1. **Rolled back the faulty deployment** to restore a stable version of the application.
2. Identified the problematic query and optimized it to avoid memory overflow.
3. Cleared up excessive database connections caused by unclosed queries.
4. Added **memory usage monitoring** to detect similar issues in the future.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures
### What can be improved?
- **Better pre-deployment testing** to catch memory-intensive operations earlier.
- **Enhanced monitoring and alerting** for memory spikes.
- **Automated rollback mechanism** to reduce downtime impact.

### TODO List
✅ Optimize database queries to prevent memory leaks.
✅ Implement **automated rollback** for failed deployments.
✅ Set up **real-time memory monitoring** with alerts for unusual spikes.
✅ Introduce **load testing in CI/CD pipeline** to catch performance bottlenecks before deployment.
✅ Conduct **team training** on best practices for handling large datasets.

## Final Thoughts
This incident highlighted the **importance of proactive monitoring, thorough testing, and quick incident response**. By implementing the corrective measures listed above, we aim to **prevent similar outages in the future** and ensure a more **robust** and **resilient** system.
